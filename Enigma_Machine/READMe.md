This program simulates the rotor encryption system of the Enigma machine. It reads ring data (standard ASCII) from a CSV file and lets you choose 3 rotors (out of 5).  
Input text is then passed through these rotors, with each step displayed, and finally converted to the last chosen rotor's output.
